# Libft

Libft is a foundational C library created to provide basic implementations of standard C functions and additional utilities. This project aims to strengthen understanding of C by re-creating functions for string manipulation, memory management, and linked lists, forming a base for more complex projects.

This library was developed as part of the curriculum at 42.
